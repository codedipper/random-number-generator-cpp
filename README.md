# Random Number Generator C++
## About
So, I was messing around with C++ and I made this.\
It's my first C++ program, and it's pretty cool, I guess.
## Compiling
Install the Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2017 and compile the C++ file using:\
`cl numberGen.cpp /EHs`
## Pre-Built
Go to the releases page, there will be a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version.
